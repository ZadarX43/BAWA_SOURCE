Project Overview:
* Objective: Create a predictive model for football match outcomes (win, draw, lose) using various statistical features.
* Model Used: Logistic Regression, initially trained on a dataset with features like points per game, goal counts, average corners and cards, and betting odds.
* Accuracy Achieved: Approximately 94%.
Data Processing and Model Training:
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: The initial dataset was cleaned and prepared for training. Essential features like 'Pre-Match PPG (Home)', 'Pre-Match PPG (Away)', and betting odds were identified and utilized.
* Model Training: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the prepared dataset. The model was saved for future use, ensuring progress wasn't lost.
* Feature Evaluation: You've identified that 'Pre-Match PPG (Home)', 'Pre-Match PPG (Away)', and betting odds are strong predictors of match outcomes.
Refinements and Iterations:
* Data Update and Refinement: You've planned to update the dataset with new match data to refine the model's accuracy.
* Model Evaluation: Further evaluations of the model are planned using new data, and you're considering additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score for a more comprehensive assessment.
* Cross-Validation and Testing: Implementing robust cross-validation techniques to evaluate model generalization on unseen data.
Next Steps and Future Plans:
* Incorporate New Data: Process and integrate new match data into the model for updated predictions.
* Performance Metrics Review: After integrating new data, evaluate the model's performance using actual outcomes versus predicted results.
* Feature Tuning: Fine-tune the model by considering additional or altered features based on the latest data and insights.
* Exploration of Mistral AI: Investigate the integration of Mistral AI into your workflow to enhance predictive capabilities.
Mission Objective:
* Leverage the predictive model for real-world deployment, focusing on betting applications. You aim to use the model's predictions, supplemented with external sentiment analysis, to make informed betting decisions.
Transfer of Context:
* For continuity, you plan to initiate a new conversation in a specific code-based GPT environment, requiring a summary of this project to ensure seamless transition and memory retention.


----------------------------------------------
* cleaned_matches_data_df: Contains detailed match statistics, including goals, corners, cards, shots, possession, and betting odds. This data is pivotal for analyzing team performances in individual matches. 
* combined_player_stats: This DataFrame holds comprehensive player statistics such as minutes played, goals, assists, disciplinary records, and various performance metrics. It's crucial for analyzing individual player contributions and overall performance. 
* df: Appears to be similar to the combined_player_stats DataFrame with extensive player statistics. Ensure that it's not a duplicate or if it serves a different purpose. 
* merged_team_player_stats: Combines team and player statistics, offering a holistic view of teams' performance in relation to their players' contributions. This data can be used to draw correlations between team success and individual player performance. 
* seasonal_player_stats: Focuses on player performance metrics like goals and assists per 90 minutes, and average ratings per season. This can be particularly useful for analyzing players' impact over different seasons. 
---------------------------------------------
* Ensure that home_team_name and away_team_name are indeed the correct columns in your match data.
* This approach will create separate datasets for home and away matches. You may need to further process these datasets for your analysis.
1. Link Players to Teams:
* Ensure each player is linked to their current team. This is usually done using the team name, but make sure that the team name is consistent across all datasets.
* If a player has switched teams, you might only want to consider the stats while they were with the relevant team.
2. Combine Player Stats with Team Match Stats:
* For each match, aggregate player stats for the players who participated in that match. This will give you a snapshot of the team's performance from the player perspective for each game.
* You can create features like average xG per player, total goals contributed by players, average player rating, etc., for each match.
3. Merge Team Performance and Match History:
* Combine the team's aggregated player stats with the match stats to add context to each game (e.g., possession, shots on target, corners).
* Include head-to-head stats to consider historical performance against the specific opponent.
4. Consider Time Frames:
* Ensure that the player stats you are aggregating are relevant to the time frame of the matches you are analyzing. For predictive modeling, you typically want to use data leading up to but not including the match you are predicting.
5. Prevent Data Leakage:
* Be careful not to include future data in your training set. For example, if you are predicting the outcome of a match, you should not include player stats from after that match.
6. Feature Engineering:
* Use the linked data to create new features that can be used in your predictive models. For example, you might calculate the impact of a key player being unavailable for a match.
Here are some considerations for why you should link these data points:
* Individual Impact: Player stats reflect individual contributions that might not be evident from team stats alone, such as a striker's goal-scoring efficiency or a goalkeeper's save rate. 
* Team Synergy: How players' stats aggregate to the team level can highlight the team's strengths and weaknesses, such as overall defensive solidity or attacking prowess. 
* Historical Context: Past performances against specific opponents can provide insights into likely outcomes, taking into account psychological factors and tactical matchups. 
* Predictive Power: Models that incorporate a broad range of data tend to have better predictive power because they capture more nuances of the game. 
* Dynamic Analysis: Player performances can fluctuate throughout the season due to form, fitness, and other factors. Linking these stats to specific matches helps to capture these dynamics. 
* Tactical Adjustments: Understanding which players are on the field can also help infer tactical setups, which can be crucial for predictions. 
To implement this:
* Link Player to Team: Ensure player stats are correctly associated with their teams.
* Time-Based Aggregation: Aggregate player stats up to the date of each match, so each game's context includes the most recent player performance data.
* Create Meaningful Features: Engineer features that meaningfully represent player contributions to team performance.
* Data Integrity: Make sure that the data you link is consistent, and there are no mismatches or errors introduced during the merge.
* Prevent Data Leakage: Be cautious not to include future data when preparing datasets for model training.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The code snippets you've provided cover a wide range of data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, feature engineering, and setting up data for modeling. Here's a breakdown of the key parts and how they contribute to the model building process:
* Checking for Missing Values:
* Ensuring that there are no missing values in your datasets is crucial. Missing data can lead to inaccuracies in the model. You've used code to check for and handle these missing values either by filling them with a default value or dropping them. 
* Outlier Detection:
* You've implemented a method using the Interquartile Range (IQR) to detect and filter out outliers from your player stats data. This helps to maintain the integrity of the model by preventing extreme values from skewing the results. 
* Feature Dropping:
* Some features that are not relevant or could introduce bias into the model are removed. For instance, you've removed features like annual_salary_gbp and shirt_number, which are likely irrelevant to the performance of the model. 
* Standardization of Names:
* By using the unidecode library, you're ensuring that player names are standardized, which is important for matching and merging data across different DataFrames. 
* Feature Engineering:
* You've created several new features such as shot_efficiency, shots_on_target_rate, conversion_rate, shooting_accuracy, defensive_pressure, and goalkeeper_performance. These engineered features can provide more insight to the model than raw data alone. 
* Form and Head-to-Head Stats:
* Calculating the form of teams based on past performances and head-to-head statistics can give the model context about the relative strength of teams going into a match. 
* Setting Up the Target Variable:
* Defining the target variable (FTR) based on the goals scored by each team in a match is crucial for supervised learning. Your target variable is what the model will predict. 
* Final Data Preparation:
* The selected features are those that the model will use as input, and they need to be consistent with what the model expects. This means ensuring that training and testing data have the same features and that they are processed in the same way. 
* Data Visualization:
* Generating histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps can provide insights into the distribution and relationships of the data. This step is not directly related to model training but is crucial for understanding and interpreting your data. 
* Model Training:
* The code for model training is not fully included in the snippets, but the process typically involves selecting a machine learning algorithm, fitting it on the training data, and then evaluating its performance using the test data. 
For automation, you can create a script or function that encapsulates these steps into a pipeline. This would allow you to preprocess and prepare new data for predictions with a consistent methodology. The script could take raw data files as input and output predictions using the trained model.
Remember to save the trained model, feature names, and any scalers or encoders used during preprocessing so that they can be re-used for making predictions on new data. This ensures consistency between the training and prediction phases.
Creating a streamlined, one-cell code execution for your entire process, from data preprocessing to model prediction, is a great way to make your workflow efficient and replicable. This can be achieved by encapsulating the entire process in a function or a series of functions. Here's a high-level outline of how you can structure this:
* Define Functions for Each Step:
    * Data Loading: Function to load datasets from specified paths.
    * Data Preprocessing: Functions to handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns, standardize names, detect and filter outliers.
    * Feature Engineering: Functions to create new features like shot efficiency, conversion rate, etc.
    * Data Merging and Transformation: Functions to merge different datasets (like team, league, and player stats) and to transform them into a format suitable for modeling.
    * Model Training: (Optional, if you want to include training in the pipeline) Function to train the model on processed data.
    * Model Prediction: Function to make predictions using the trained model.
* Create a Main Function:
    * This function will call all the other functions in the correct order.
    * Ensure that it accepts raw data file paths as inputs.
    * It should output the predictions or the desired results.
* Load and Save Essential Components:
    * If the model and other components (like encoders, scalers) are already trained and saved, ensure your main function loads them correctly for use in predictions.
* Testing and Validation:
    * Before consolidating everything into one cell, test each function individually to ensure they work as expected.
    * Run the entire pipeline with test data to validate the end-to-end process.
* Consolidation:
    * Once you have all functions tested and validated, consolidate them into a single cell. Call the main function with the necessary inputs (file paths) to execute the pipeline.
Here’s a very simplified version of what the final consolidated function could look like in code:
python

Copy code
def run_pipeline(data_paths): # Load data league_stats, matches, players, teams = load_data(data_paths) # Preprocess data league_stats = preprocess_league_stats(league_stats) matches = preprocess_matches(matches) players = preprocess_players(players) teams = preprocess_teams(teams) # Merge data merged_data = merge_data(league_stats, matches, players, teams) # Feature engineering merged_data = engineer_features(merged_data) # Load model and make predictions model = load_model('model_path') predictions = model.predict(merged_data) return predictions # Example usage data_paths = { 'league_stats_path': 'path/to/league_stats.csv', 'matches_path': 'path/to/matches.csv', 'players_path': 'path/to/players.csv', 'teams_path': 'path/to/teams.csv' } predictions = run_pipeline(data_paths) 
Remember, the complexity of your actual functions will depend on the specifics of your data and model. This is a simplified template to give you a starting point.

HIGH LEVEL APPROACH TO HEAD TO HEAD STATS AND FOR VERIFICATION CHECKING

* Extract Numerical Features from 'head_to_head': Convert the string representation of dictionaries into actual dictionaries and then extract the numerical values. 
* Preprocess the Dataset: Modify the preprocessing steps to accommodate these changes. 
Extracting 'head_to_head' Features
python

Copy code
import ast # to safely evaluate strings as code # Convert string representations of dictionaries to actual dictionaries df['head_to_head'] = df['head_to_head'].apply(ast.literal_eval) # Extract numerical features df['home_wins_head_to_head'] = df['head_to_head'].apply(lambda x: x.get('home_wins', 0)) df['away_wins_head_to_head'] = df['head_to_head'].apply(lambda x: x.get('away_wins', 0)) df['draws_head_to_head'] = df['head_to_head'].apply(lambda x: x.get('draws', 0)) # Drop the original 'head_to_head' column df = df.drop(columns=['head_to_head']) 
Modified Preprocessing
Now, update your preprocessing steps to exclude the 'head_to_head' column and process the newly extracted features.
python

Copy code
# Update categorical and numeric features categorical_features = ['league'] numeric_features = [col for col in df.columns if col not in categorical_features + ['head_to_head']] # Proceed with your preprocessing steps as before 
This approach should resolve the error you're encountering. The idea is to ensure that all features going into the model are in a format that the machine learning algorithms can interpret and use effectively.


# Handling division by zero
combined_player_stats['shot_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats.apply(
    lambda row: row['goals_overall'] / row['shots_total_overall'] if row['shots_total_overall'] > 0 else 0, axis=1
)


# Shot Efficiency
combined_player_stats['shot_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats['goals_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_total_overall']

# Shots on Target Rate
combined_player_stats['shots_on_target_rate'] = combined_player_stats['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_total_overall']

# Conversion Rate
combined_player_stats['conversion_rate'] = combined_player_stats['goals_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_on_target_total_overall']

# Shooting Accuracy
combined_player_stats['shooting_accuracy'] = combined_player_stats['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_total_overall']

# Defensive Pressure
combined_player_stats['defensive_pressure'] = combined_player_stats['shots_faced_total_overall'] / combined_player_stats['appearances_overall']

# Goalkeeping Performance
# Assuming 'goals_conceded_overall' is the number of goals a goalkeeper has conceded
combined_player_stats['goalkeeper_performance'] = combined_player_stats['goals_conceded_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_faced_total_overall']

# Long-Shot Specialist
combined_player_stats['long_shot_specialist'] = combined_player_stats['shots_total_overall'] - combined_player_stats['shots_on_target_total_overall']

# Shot Conversion Rate Standardized
shot_conversion_mean = combined_player_stats['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].mean()
shot_conversion_std = combined_player_stats['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].std()
combined_player_stats['shot_conversion_rate_standardized'] = (combined_player_stats['shot_conversion_rate_overall'] - shot_conversion_mean) / shot_conversion_std

# Before running this code, ensure that there are no divisions by zero and handle any NaN values that may result from these computations.


Based on the shot-related columns you've provided from your combined_player_stats DataFrame, here are some feature ideas that could be valuable for predictive modeling:
* Shot Efficiency: A ratio of goals scored to total shots taken can provide a measure of a player's finishing quality.
    * df['shot_efficiency'] = df['goals_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Shots on Target Rate: The proportion of shots that are on target can be an indicator of a team's offensive threat.
    * df['shots_on_target_rate'] = df['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Conversion Rate: The percentage of shots on target that turn into goals.
    * df['conversion_rate'] = df['goals_overall'] / df['shots_on_target_total_overall']
* Shooting Accuracy: A comparison between shots on target and shots taken.
    * df['shooting_accuracy'] = df['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Defensive Pressure: The number of shots a team faces can indicate the amount of defensive pressure they are under.
    * df['defensive_pressure'] = df['shots_faced_total_overall'] / df['appearances_overall']
* Goalkeeping Performance: Metrics related to the goalkeeper's performance, such as shots faced and save percentage.
    * df['goalkeeper_performance'] = df['goals_conceded_overall'] / df['shots_faced_total_overall']
* Long-Shot Specialist: Identifying players who have a higher than usual number of long-range shots.
    * df['long_shot_specialist'] = df['shots_total_overall'] - df['shots_on_target_total_overall']
* Shot Conversion Rate Standardized: Normalizing shot conversion rate across the league to identify outliers.
    * df['shot_conversion_rate_standardized'] = (df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'] - df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].mean()) / df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].std()
# Create new features based on identified relationships

# Shots efficiency feature
combined_player_stats['shots_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats['shots_total_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_per_game_overall']

# Passing accuracy feature
combined_player_stats['pass_accuracy'] = combined_player_stats['passes_completed_overall'] / combined_player_stats['passes_per_game_overall']

# Chances created efficiency feature
combined_player_stats['chances_created_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats['key_passes_per_game_overall'] / combined_player_stats['chances_created_per_90_overall']

# Defensive actions feature
combined_player_stats['defensive_actions'] = combined_player_stats['tackles_per_90_overall'] + combined_player_stats['interceptions_per_90_overall']

# Goalkeeper performance feature
combined_player_stats['goalkeeper_performance'] = combined_player_stats['saves_per90_percentile_overall'] / combined_player_stats['shots_faced_per_90_overall']

# Duels won efficiency feature
combined_player_stats['duels_won_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats['duels_won_per_game_overall'] / combined_player_stats['duels_per_90_overall']

# Travelled distance feature
combined_player_stats['travelled_distance_efficiency'] = combined_player_stats['distance_travelled_total_overall'] / combined_player_stats['minutes_played_overall']

# Make sure to handle any potential division by zero or missing values appropriately
* Shots Efficiency: shots_total_overall divided by shots_per_game_overall could give you an efficiency measure.
* Pass Accuracy: Relate passes_completed_overall with passes_per_game_overall to compute an accuracy percentage.
* Defensive Actions: Combine tackles_per_90_overall, interceptions_per_90_overall, and duels_won_per_90_overall to create a defensive index.
* Goalkeeper Performance: Use saves_per_90_overall and xg_faced_total_overall to evaluate a goalkeeper's performance relative to the expected goals they faced.
* Player Influence: Use distance_travelled_total_overall and duels_won_percentage_overall to gauge a player's influence on the pitch.
Here's how you might code some of these features. Assume df is your main DataFrame with all the player stats:
python

Copy code
# Shots Efficiency df['shots_efficiency'] = df['shots_total_overall'] / df['shots_per_game_overall'] # Pass Accuracy df['pass_accuracy'] = df['passes_completed_overall'] / df['passes_per_game_overall'] # Defensive Actions df['defensive_index'] = df[['tackles_per_90_overall', 'interceptions_per_90_overall', 'duels_won_per_90_overall']].mean(axis=1) # Goalkeeper Performance df['goalkeeper_performance'] = df['saves_per_90_overall'] / df['xg_faced_total_overall'] # Player Influence df['player_influence'] = df['distance_travelled_total_overall'] * df['duels_won_percentage_overall'] 
Before proceeding to model updating and training, you would need to ensure that these new features are correctly scaled and that any categorical variables are encoded. You would also need to handle any missing values that might arise from creating these new features.
* Clusters: The presence of clusters may suggest groups of features that behave similarly or have a relationship with one another. For example, if you notice a cluster around defensive metrics like tackles, interceptions, and clearances, it could indicate that these features are correlated and may jointly contribute to a defensive strength factor in your model. 
* Correlation: Darker squares along the diagonal indicate a high correlation, which is expected for a feature with itself. Off-diagonal darker squares indicate a potential correlation between two different features. 
* Potential Features: Clusters or correlated features could potentially be combined into new features. For instance, if 'shots_per_90_overall' and 'goals_per_90_overall' are correlated, you might create a feature that represents shooting efficiency. 
* Noise: Scattered points without a discernible pattern may suggest little to no correlation, which could be considered noise. Features that do not show any correlation with others might be less useful for your predictive model. 
* Diagonal Line: The diagonal line of perfect correlation (from the bottom left to the top right) is where each variable intersects with itself. It’s always perfectly correlated and not of particular interest when looking for relationships between different features. 
It seems like your dataset doesn't have a column named 'favorite_based_on_odds'. This column was supposed to represent which team was favored to win based on the betting odds. Since this column isn't present in your dataset, you'll need to create it based on the available odds data.
Here's how you can create the 'favorite_based_on_odds' column. The idea is to compare the odds of the home team winning, the away team winning, and a draw. The team with the lowest odds (implying they are the favorite) will be marked as the favorite for that match.
Step 2: Creating 'favorite_based_on_odds'
python

Copy code
def determine_favorite(row): home_odds = row['odds_ft_home_team_win'] draw_odds = row['odds_ft_draw'] away_odds = row['odds_ft_away_team_win'] if min(home_odds, draw_odds, away_odds) == home_odds: return 'Home' elif min(home_odds, draw_odds, away_odds) == away_odds: return 'Away' else: return 'Draw' # Apply the function to each row cleaned_matches_data_df['favorite_based_on_odds'] = cleaned_matches_data_df.apply(determine_favorite, axis=1) 
Step 2.1: Odds Accuracy
After creating the 'favorite_based_on_odds' column, you can proceed to calculate the odds accuracy as previously mentioned. This will compare the predicted outcome with the favorite based on the betting odds.
python

Copy code
# Convert the 'favorite_based_on_odds' to a binary outcome similar to 'FTR' # Assuming 'Home' win is 0 and 'Away' win or 'Draw' is 1 cleaned_matches_data_df['favorite_binary'] = (cleaned_matches_data_df['favorite_based_on_odds'] != 'Home').astype(int) # Calculate odds accuracy cleaned_matches_data_df['odds_accuracy'] = (cleaned_matches_data_df['favorite_binary'] == cleaned_matches_data_df['FTR']).astype(int) 
Now, you can analyze the odds_accuracy to understand how often the favorite (based on betting odds) actually wins the match. This information can be valuable for identifying patterns or indicators of why a team failed when they were expected to win.
Step 2: Analyzing Betting Odds
2.1 Odds Accuracy
Create a feature to compare the predicted outcome with the betting odds.
python

Copy code
# Assuming 'favorite_based_on_odds' is the column that shows the expected winner based on odds cleaned_matches_data_df['odds_accuracy'] = (cleaned_matches_data_df['favorite_based_on_odds'] == cleaned_matches_data_df['FTR']).astype(int) 
2.2 Analyzing Discrepancies
For matches where betting odds were incorrect, analyze other match features.
python

Copy code
incorrect_odds_df = cleaned_matches_data_df[cleaned_matches_data_df['odds_accuracy'] == 0] # Perform analysis on 'incorrect_odds_df' to find patterns 
Step 1: Predicting Full-Time Results
1.1 Define the Target Variable
Assuming your dataframe is named cleaned_matches_data_df and the target variable is whether the home team wins (0) or doesn't win (1 - draw or away win).
python

Copy code
cleaned_matches_data_df['FTR'] = (cleaned_matches_data_df['home_team_goal_count'] <= cleaned_matches_data_df['away_team_goal_count']).astype(int) 
1.2 Feature Selection
Select features that you think will be predictive. This is just an example, adjust according to your data.
python

Copy code
features = ['Pre-Match PPG (Home)', 'Pre-Match PPG (Away)', 'home_team_goal_count', 'away_team_goal_count', 'average_corners_per_match_pre_match', 'average_cards_per_match_pre_match', 'odds_ft_home_team_win', 'odds_ft_draw', 'odds_ft_away_team_win'] 
1.3 Model Training
 Predicting Full-Time Results:
* Target Variable: Define a target variable that represents the outcome of the match (e.g., home win, draw, away win).
* Feature Selection: Choose features that are likely to influence match outcomes. These could include team stats (like form, head-to-head performance), player stats (like key player availability, average player rating), and external factors (like game location).
* Model Training: Use classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost. Train these models on your dataset to predict the match outcomes.
* Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to assess the generalizability of your models.
2. Analyzing Betting Odds:
* Odds Accuracy: Create a feature to compare the predicted outcome from your model with the outcome suggested by the betting odds.
* Patterns in Odds Inaccuracy: Analyze instances where betting odds were incorrect. Look for common characteristics in these matches. It might be specific teams, leagues, or types of matches where odds are less reliable.
* Feature Engineering: Based on your findings, engineer new features that might capture why certain matches defy the odds. For example, a feature for 'upset likelihood' based on historical data of upsets in similar situations.
3. Creating a Betting Odds Correctness Feature:
* Betting Odds vs Actual Outcome: For each match, check if the betting odds' predicted outcome (favorite based on lowest odds) matches the actual outcome. This can be a binary feature (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect).
* Analyzing Discrepancies: For matches where betting odds were incorrect, analyze other match features to find patterns. Are upsets more common in certain leagues, during specific game weeks, or with certain referees?
The descriptive statistics you provided give an overview of the data in your match and players dataframes. These statistics are valuable for understanding the general trends and distributions in your data.
Observations from match Data:
* Game Week: Ranges from 1 to 6, suggesting this dataset covers the early part of a season.
* Goals: Home teams seem to score slightly more on average (about 1.45 goals per game) compared to away teams (around 0.87 goals per game).
* Total Goals: Average of around 2.32 goals per match.
* Betting Odds: Indicate the perceived likelihoods of various outcomes (home win, draw, away win, over/under goals, etc.).
Observations from players Data:
* Age: Players range from 15 to 41 years old, with an average age around 25.6 years.
* Minutes Played: Shows a wide range, indicating varying levels of participation among players.
* Goals: Most players have not scored goals, reflecting the usual distribution in a football team.
* Percentiles: Various percentile metrics (like goals per 90 minutes, cards per 90 minutes) that indicate a player's performance relative to others.
Next Steps in Analysis:
* Further EDA: Look for trends and patterns. For example, how does home advantage affect goal scoring? Or, what's the relationship between a player's age and their performance metrics? 
* Feature Engineering: Based on your observations, create new features that could be predictive of match outcomes. For instance:
    * Aggregate player stats to the team level (e.g., average goals scored by team members, average player age per team).
    * Calculate recent form metrics for teams.
    * Compute head-to-head performance statistics.
* Data Visualization: Use plots (like histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to visually explore the relationships in your data. This can provide intuitive insights that aren't immediately obvious from raw numbers. 
* Predictive Modeling: Once you've thoroughly explored and prepared your data, you can start building predictive models. Choose appropriate models based on the nature of your data and the specific questions you're trying to answer. 
* Model Evaluation: Test your models to see how well they predict match outcomes. Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc., to evaluate performance. 
* Iterative Improvement: Continuously refine your models and features based on performance feedback. 
Remember, the goal of EDA and feature engineering is to understand the data as deeply as possible and to craft features that will be most useful for your predictive models. If you need guidance on specific aspects of this process, feel free to ask!



To proceed with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the correct dataset, you need to define the specific dataframe you want to analyze. Since you have multiple datasets, such as cleaned_matches_data_df, combined_player_stats, and others, you should choose the one that aligns best with the analysis you want to conduct.
For example, if you want to analyze match statistics, you would use cleaned_matches_data_df. For player statistics, you would use combined_player_stats.
Here's how you would modify the EDA code snippet for each of these specific dataframes:
For Match Statistics (using cleaned_matches_data_df):
python

Copy code
# Assuming you have already loaded cleaned_matches_data_df print(cleaned_matches_data_df.describe()) # Histograms for continuous variables in matches data cleaned_matches_data_df[['home_team_goal_count', 'away_team_goal_count']].hist(bins=15, figsize=(15, 6)) # Scatter Plot for relationships in matches data plt.scatter(cleaned_matches_data_df['home_team_shots'], cleaned_matches_data_df['home_team_goal_count']) plt.xlabel('Home Team Shots') plt.ylabel('Home Team Goals') plt.title('Home Team Shots vs Goals') # Correlation Heatmap for matches data corr_matches = cleaned_matches_data_df.corr() plt.figure(figsize=(10,10)) sns.heatmap(corr_matches, annot=True, fmt=".2f") 
For Player Statistics (using combined_player_stats):
python

Copy code
# Assuming you have already loaded combined_player_stats print(combined_player_stats.describe()) # Histograms for continuous variables in player stats combined_player_stats[['age', 'minutes_played_overall', 'goals_per_90_overall']].hist(bins=15, figsize=(15, 6)) # Scatter Plot for relationships in player stats plt.scatter(combined_player_stats['goals_overall'], combined_player_stats['assists_overall']) plt.xlabel('Goals') plt.ylabel('Assists') plt.title('Goals vs Assists in Player Stats') # Correlation Heatmap for player stats corr_players = combined_player_stats.corr() plt.figure(figsize=(10,10)) sns.heatmap(corr_players, annot=True, fmt=".2f") 
Make sure to load the appropriate dataframe into your Colab environment before running these snippets. If you need assistance with loading the data or with specific analyses, please let me know!
Step 3: Calculate Head-to-Head Stats
Head-to-head statistics can provide insights into how teams have performed against each other in the past. Here's a basic approach to calculate head-to-head stats:
python

Copy code
def calculate_head_to_head_stats(df, home_team, away_team): """ Calculate head-to-head statistics between two teams. """ # Filter matches where either team was playing at home against the other head_to_head_matches = df[((df['home_team_name'] == home_team) & (df['away_team_name'] == away_team)) | ((df['home_team_name'] == away_team) & (df['away_team_name'] == home_team))] # Calculate stats like number of wins, draws, losses, goals scored, etc. home_wins = len(head_to_head_matches[(head_to_head_matches['home_team_name'] == home_team) & (head_to_head_matches['home_team_goal_count'] > head_to_head_matches['away_team_goal_count'])]) away_wins = len(head_to_head_matches[(head_to_head_matches['home_team_name'] == away_team) & (head_to_head_matches['home_team_goal_count'] < head_to_head_matches['away_team_goal_count'])]) draws = len(head_to_head_matches[head_to_head_matches['home_team_goal_count'] == head_to_head_matches['away_team_goal_count']]) # Return a dictionary of stats return { 'home_wins': home_wins, 'away_wins': away_wins, 'draws': draws } # Apply the function to each match cleaned_matches_data_df['head_to_head'] = cleaned_matches_data_df.apply( lambda row: calculate_head_to_head_stats(cleaned_matches_data_df, row['home_team_name'], row['away_team_name']), axis=1) 
Step 4: Create a Full Time Result (FTR) Column
The Full Time Result (FTR) column can be created to indicate the result of each match. You can encode it as '0' for a home win, '1' for a draw or away win:
python

Copy code
def calculate_ftr(home_goals, away_goals): if home_goals > away_goals: return 0 # Home win else: return 1 # Draw or Away win cleaned_matches_data_df['FTR'] = cleaned_matches_data_df.apply( lambda row: calculate_ftr(row['home_team_goal_count'], row['away_team_goal_count']), axis=1)
* Define the Form Calculation Function:
    * This function calculates the form based on recent matches. For simplicity, let's say a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point, and a loss gives 0 points.
* Apply the Function to Each Team:
    * Apply this function to both home and away teams in your DataFrame.
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a 'form' column:
Step 1: Define the Form Calculation Function
python

Copy code
def calculate_form(df, team_name, n_matches=5): """ Calculate the form of a team over the last n matches. """ recent_matches = df[df['home_team_name'] == team_name].tail(n_matches) points = 0 for index, row in recent_matches.iterrows(): if row['home_team_goal_count'] > row['away_team_goal_count']: points += 3 # Home win elif row['home_team_goal_count'] == row['away_team_goal_count']: points += 1 # Draw return points / (3 * n_matches) # Return the average points per match 
Step 2: Apply the Function to Create the Form Column
python

Copy code
# Calculate form for each team and each match cleaned_matches_data_df['home_team_form'] = cleaned_matches_data_df.apply( lambda row: calculate_form(cleaned_matches_data_df, row['home_team_name']), axis=1) cleaned_matches_data_df['away_team_form'] = cleaned_matches_data_df.apply( lambda row: calculate_form(cleaned_matches_data_df, row['away_team_name']), axis=1) 
This will add two new columns to your DataFrame: 'home_team_form' and 
ChatGPT

Certainly! Calculating form, head-to-head stats, and creating a Full Time Result (FTR) column can be valuable for your predictive model. Let's go step by step:
1. Calculating Team Form
Team form can be calculated based on recent match results. Let's say we define "form" as the results of the last 5 matches.
python

Copy code
# Function to calculate form def calculate_form(df, num_matches): form = [] for team in df['team_name'].unique(): team_matches = df[(df['home_team_name'] == team) | (df['away_team_name'] == team)] team_matches = team_matches.sort_values('date_GMT').tail(num_matches) team_form = 0 for index, row in team_matches.iterrows(): if row['home_team_name'] == team: if row['home_team_goal_count'] > row['away_team_goal_count']: team_form += 3 # Win elif row['home_team_goal_count'] == row['away_team_goal_count']: team_form += 1 # Draw elif row['away_team_name'] == team: if row['away_team_goal_count'] > row['home_team_goal_count']: team_form += 3 # Win elif row['away_team_goal_count'] == row['home_team_goal_count']: team_form += 1 # Draw form.append({'team': team, 'form': team_form}) return pd.DataFrame(form) # Calculate form for teams team_form_df = calculate_form(cleaned_matches_data_df, 5) 
2. Calculating Head-to-Head Stats
Head-to-head stats involve looking at past encounters between the two teams.
python

Copy code
def head_to_head_stats(df, team1, team2): matches = df[((df['home_team_name'] == team1) & (df['away_team_name'] == team2)) | ((df['home_team_name'] == team2) & (df['away_team_name'] == team1))] # Perform calculations to find head-to-head stats # ... # Example usage head_to_head_stats(cleaned_matches_data_df, 'Team A', 'Team B') 
3. Form Average
Form average can be an average points per game over the last few matches.
python

Copy code
team_form_df['form_average'] = team_form_df['form'] / 5 # Assuming 5 is the number of matches considered for form 
4. Creating FTR Column
The FTR column can be created by comparing goals scored by home and away teams.
python

Copy code
def create_ftr_column(df): df['FTR'] = df.apply(lambda row: 0 if row['home_team_goal_count'] > row['away_team_goal_count'] else 1, axis=1) create_ftr_column(cleaned_matches_data_df) 
Great to hear that the code ran successfully! With the player statistics merged with match data, you have enriched your dataset, which is crucial for building a more accurate predictive model.



Merging player statistics with match data involves combining the detailed player data with the corresponding match records. Since player stats are individual, and match data are team-based, you'll need to aggregate the player stats at the team level for each match. Here's a step-by-step approach:
* Aggregate Player Stats at Team Level:
    * For each match, you need to aggregate the player stats for the players who played in that match. This could include calculating average ratings, total goals, assists, etc., for all players from each team who participated in that match.
* Create a Key for Merging:
    * Ensure both datasets (player stats and match data) have a common key for merging. This could be a combination of team name and match date or match ID if available.
* Merge Datasets:
    * Use the common key to merge the aggregated player stats with the match data. This will result in a dataset where each match record is enriched with the player stats of the teams involved.
Here's a simplified example of how you might do this in Python:
python

Copy code
import pandas as pd # Example: Aggregating player stats for a team in a particular match # Let's say you have a function that takes a team name and a date and returns the aggregated stats for that team def get_team_stats_for_match(team_name, match_date, player_stats_df): # Filter player stats for the given team and date # Aggregate stats as needed (e.g., average rating, total goals) # Return aggregated stats as a pandas Series or DataFrame row pass # Loop through each match in the match data for index, row in cleaned_matches_data_df.iterrows(): # Get team names and match date home_team = row['home_team_name'] away_team = row['away_team_name'] match_date = row['date_GMT'] # Get aggregated stats for both teams home_team_stats = get_team_stats_for_match(home_team, match_date, combined_player_stats) away_team_stats = get_team_stats_for_match(away_team, match_date, combined_player_stats) # Merge these stats into the match data row # This can be done by setting new columns in 'row' or by merging Series/DataFrames # Now 'cleaned_matches_data_df' will have additional columns for each team's player stats 
This is a high-level approach, and the specific implementation will depend on how your data is structured and what stats you're interested in. The key challenge is to correctly align the player stats with the corresponding matches, ensuring the data integrity is maintained.




--------------------------

Based on the shot-related columns you've provided from your combined_player_stats DataFrame, here are some feature ideas that could be valuable for predictive modeling:
* Shot Efficiency: A ratio of goals scored to total shots taken can provide a measure of a player's finishing quality.
    * df['shot_efficiency'] = df['goals_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Shots on Target Rate: The proportion of shots that are on target can be an indicator of a team's offensive threat.
    * df['shots_on_target_rate'] = df['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Conversion Rate: The percentage of shots on target that turn into goals.
    * df['conversion_rate'] = df['goals_overall'] / df['shots_on_target_total_overall']
* Shooting Accuracy: A comparison between shots on target and shots taken.
    * df['shooting_accuracy'] = df['shots_on_target_total_overall'] / df['shots_total_overall']
* Defensive Pressure: The number of shots a team faces can indicate the amount of defensive pressure they are under.
    * df['defensive_pressure'] = df['shots_faced_total_overall'] / df['appearances_overall']
* Goalkeeping Performance: Metrics related to the goalkeeper's performance, such as shots faced and save percentage.
    * df['goalkeeper_performance'] = df['goals_conceded_overall'] / df['shots_faced_total_overall']
* Long-Shot Specialist: Identifying players who have a higher than usual number of long-range shots.
    * df['long_shot_specialist'] = df['shots_total_overall'] - df['shots_on_target_total_overall']
* Shot Conversion Rate Standardized: Normalizing shot conversion rate across the league to identify outliers.
    * df['shot_conversion_rate_standardized'] = (df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'] - df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].mean()) / df['shot_conversion_rate_overall'].std()

------------------------
Ensemble Learning:
* Meta-Model: Use the predictions from each league-specific model as features for a higher-level model, sometimes called a meta-model or ensemble model, which makes the final prediction.
Weighted Averaging:
* Performance Weights: Assign weights to each league-specific prediction based on the historical accuracy of the respective model, and use these weights to calculate a weighted average prediction.
Voting Systems:
* Majority Voting: Use a simple majority voting system where the most common prediction amongst all league-specific models is chosen as the final prediction.
* Weighted Voting: Similar to weighted averaging, but instead of averaging predictions, each model's vote is weighted by its performance, and the final prediction is decided by weighted vote count.
Stacking:
* Stacked Generalization: Stack the predictions of each league-specific model and use another model to learn how to best combine these predictions.
Bayesian Methods:
* Probabilistic Models: Use the probabilities from each model's predictions to inform a Bayesian model that considers the likelihood of certain outcomes given the predictions from the league-specific models.
Cross-League Analysis:
* Correlation Analysis: Before combining predictions, analyze the correlation between league-specific results to understand if trends in one league are indicative of trends in another.
Hybrid Approaches:
* Combine Features and Predictions: Use both the raw features from each league and the predictions of the league-specific models as input features to a more comprehensive model.
Implementation Considerations:
* Data Synchronization: Ensure that the data from each league is synchronized in terms of timeframes and match dates to correctly align the predictions.
* Model Calibration: Calibrate each league-specific model so that the predicted probabilities are comparable across models.
* Update Frequency: Decide how often the overall model needs to be updated based on the frequency of matches in each league.
By using these techniques, you can create a robust system that benefits from both the specificity of league-focused models and the generalizability of an overarching prediction framework. This approach is particularly useful if you're interested in outcomes that span across leagues, like betting across multiple markets or analyzing trends in football more broadly.
It's also essential to validate the combined model thoroughly to ensure that it improves—or at least does not detract from—the performance of individual league models.
